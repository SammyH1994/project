## Week 2
### Day 1
- Worked on map

### Day 2
- Map: data with values for population
- Map: colours with values for population
- Issue: population doesn't change much over years

### Day 3
- Map finished except for legend
- Population pyramid nearly finished
- Issue: age group data is not by gender, so traditional population pyramid is not possible.  
Solution right now: instead of two pyramids, have one pyramid, where the left side of pyramid is Limburg, right side is province X.  
Possible other solution: find data per gender. However, this data is per age instead of age group, so would have to be rewritten first.

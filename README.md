## Problem Statement
Recently, it became known that the number of baby's born with a birth defect is alarmingly higher in Limburg than in any other province of the Netherlands: 3.84% in Limburg compared to the national average of 2.84% ([Source](https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20180524_00062550/alarmerend-meer-baby-s-met-afwijkingen-in-limburg)). 

This raises the question of how Limburg is different from other provinces in the Netherlands, and what the potential reasons for this difference in baby's born with a birth defect are. 

Is Limburg, for instance, different in population structure, income, social security, environment etc?

This question is interesting not only for the population of Limburg (and specifically those who have or wish to start a family there), but also for potential future residents of Limburg who are trying to decide where in the Netherlands they want to settle.

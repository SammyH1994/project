## Problem Statement
Recently, it became known that the number of baby's born with a birth defect is alarmingly higher in Limburg than in any other province of the Netherlands: 3.84% in Limburg compared to the national average of 2.84% ([Source](https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20180524_00062550/alarmerend-meer-baby-s-met-afwijkingen-in-limburg)). 

This raises the question of how Limburg is different from other provinces in the Netherlands, and what the potential reasons for this difference in baby's born with a birth defect are. 

Is Limburg, for instance, different in population structure, income, social security, environment etc?

This question is interesting not only for the population of Limburg (and specifically those who have or wish to start a family there), but also for potential future residents of Limburg who are trying to decide where in the Netherlands they want to settle.

## Solution
This visualization aims to compare Limburg to the other provinces of the Netherlands with regards to several variables: population size, population structure, births and deaths, migration background, causes of death, work, income, social security, education, traffic and transport, environment, and soil use. 

This will be accomplished by having three interactive visualizations: a map of the Netherlands that vidsualizes relative population size per province, two population pyramids that compare Limburg to a certain province that is chosen by clicking on the map, and a grouped barchart that shows the variables of a chosen topic for both Limburg and a chosen province of the map. A sketch of the visualization can be found below.
